{"information": "**Title:** Resources and Development\n\n**Subtopics:**\n\n**1. What is a Resource?**\n\n* Definition: Anything that can be used to satisfy a need.\n* Examples: Water, electricity, food, textbooks.\n* Utility or usability is what makes an object or substance a resource.\n\n**2. Types of Resources**\n\n* **Natural Resources:**\n    * Drawn from nature and used without modification.\n    * Examples: Air, water, soil, minerals.\n    * **Renewable Resources:**\n        * Get renewed or replenished quickly.\n        * Examples: Solar energy, wind energy.\n    * **Non-Renewable Resources:**\n        * Limited stock.\n        * Examples: Coal, petroleum, natural gas.\n* **Human Made Resources:**\n    * Created from natural resources.\n    * Examples: Buildings, bridges, vehicles.\n* **Human Resources:**\n    * People with knowledge, skill, and technology.\n    * Education and health contribute to human resource development.\n\n**3. Conserving Resources**\n\n* **Resource Conservation:** Using resources carefully and allowing them to renew.\n* **Sustainable Development:** Balancing resource use with conservation for future generations.\n* Ways to Conserve Resources:\n    * Reduce consumption.\n    * Recycle and reuse.\n    * Examples: Using old newspapers for shopping bags, saving water and electricity.\n\n**4. Principles of Sustainable Development**\n\n* Respect and care for all life.\n* Improve human life quality.\n* Conserve earth's diversity.\n* Minimize damage to natural systems.\n* Change personal attitudes and practices.\n* Enable communities to care for their environment.\n\n**Important Dates and Formulae:**\n\n* None given in the provided text.\n**Title: Resources and Development**\n\n**Subtopics:**\n\n**1. Types of Resources**\n\n* **Renewable resources:** Can be replenished naturally (e.g., water, forests)\n* **Non-renewable resources:** Finite and cannot be replaced once depleted (e.g., fossil fuels, minerals)\n\n**Important Date:**\n\n* **2023-24:** Rationalised publication date\n\n**2. Importance of Water**\n\n* Essential for all life forms\n* Supports industries, agriculture, and transportation\n* If water disappeared, life would cease to exist\n\n**3. Wind as a Resource**\n\n* **Prehistoric times:** Wind could be used for:\n    * Transportation (e.g., sailing ships)\n    * Powering machines (e.g., windmills)\n* **Year 2138:** Wind is now an important resource for:\n    * Generating renewable energy (e.g., wind turbines)\n    * Reducing air pollution (e.g., wind farms)\n\n**4. Resourcefulness**\n\n* Using materials creatively to meet needs\n* Examples:\n    * Stone: Tool, weapon, decoration\n    * Leaf: Plate, wrapping, decoration\n    * Paper straw: Toy, tool, decoration\n    * Twig: Tool, decoration, weapon\n\n**Important Formulae or Methodologies:**\n\n* None mentioned in the provided text"}
