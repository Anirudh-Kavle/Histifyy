{"information": [{"title": "The Human Eye", "text": "Imagine you have a magical camera inside your head that lets you see the world around you. That's what your eye is!\nYour eye is like a small, round ball with a clear front part called the cornea. It's like a window that lets light into your eye. Behind the cornea is a colored part called the iris. The iris can change size to let more or less light in, just like the shutter of a camera.\nIn the center of the iris is a black hole called the pupil. It's through the pupil that light travels into your eye. Inside your eye, there's a special lens that makes an image of the world on the back of your eye. This part is called the retina.\nThe retina has tiny cells that turn the image into electrical signals. These signals travel to your brain, which turns them back into an image that you can see. It's like your brain is a supercomputer that processes all the information from your eyes to create the world you see.\n", "img": "https://replicate.delivery/pbxt/pHdkDkSplcZiCNi2RfVMI2yIoyMa1z888x7KVzqVfsfFHQKlA/out-0.png"}, {"title": "Defects of Vision and Their Correction", "text": "Sometimes, your eyes might not work perfectly.

Rainbows are caused by refraction, which is when light changes direction when it passes from one material to another.\nYou can see refraction in action with a prism. A prism is a clear, triangular piece of glass. When light passes through a prism, it bends. This is because the speed of light is different in glass than it is in air.\nThe different colors of light bend at different angles, so when white light passes through a prism, it's separated into a rainbow of colors. This is called dispersion.\n", "img": "https://replicate.delivery/pbxt/gWN4ewdcK4xUMSM3uSv3lf6XBPqthoBaUWiZ5whZcqVsDIlSA/out-0.png"}, {"title": "Dispersion of White Light by a Prism", "text": "Sir Isaac Newton was a brilliant scientist who used prisms to study light. He discovered that white light is actually a mixture of all the colors of the rainbow.\nWhen white light passes through a prism, it's dispersed into a band of colors called a spectrum. The colors are arranged from red on one end to violet on the other.\n", "img": "https://replicate.delivery/pbxt/qhZ4E9Fh2f22Py6thWfQFaHjVIc7ONDrleIMcDGpotQgHQKlA/out-0.png"}, {"title": "Rainbow Formation", "text": "Rainbows are formed when sunlight passes through raindrops in the atmosphere. The raindrops act like tiny prisms, refracting and dispersing the sunlight.\nThe colors of the rainbow are always in the same order, with red on the outside and violet on the inside. This is because the different colors of light bend at different angles.\n", "img": "https://replicate.delivery/pbxt/N9jP3UzPMr4hLNBm6yxP46mUo0CaHcgga7JA9EW83so9ASpE/out-0.png"}]}
